# About

MovieMentor is an application developed by Jeffrey DiVincent, Adam Fernandes, Jacob Franz, Nathanael Gaulke, Lauren Morris, and Garrett Spears as part of our Senior Design Project for Computer Science at the University of Central Florida.

We wanted to create a place where users could gain more detailed information on potential trauma and content sensitivities found in certain movies. The MPAA rating system has a general guideline for ages and content found in movies, but has been subject to differing classification over the years making it merely a starting point. We have also used sites like Common Sense Media and Does the Dog Die, however we found that they focused on parental guidance and extremely traumatic events. We wanted to have a more wider platform that accommodated all sorts of potentially sensitive issues to serve a wider audience and include other groups of trauma that may be overlooked by the general population. Additionally, we designed the platform so that a user could hide content warnings they do not want to come in contact with at all, as well as reduce the chance of movie spoilers by having users opt to look closer at a content warning they might be on the fence about.

We hope that you find this application useful in your search for new movies to watch that are interesting and trauma-free to you.

# How to Use MovieMentor

## Browsing

Before looking for movies, we recommend going to Settings > Content Warnings. There you can choose whether to filter content warnings by choosing to show, warn, or hide them. To see the warnings for a specific movie, first search it up. If the movie does not appear, this could mean that the movie contains content that you have chosen to "hide" in settings. Otherwise, click on the desired result. If the movie contains material that you want to be warned about, a warning will appear near the top of the page and all warnings associated with that content will be highlighted. All content warnings submitted for the movie are at the bottom of the page. Clicking the warning, opens a popup with a description of the content. If you have watched the movie, we kindly ask that you confirm or refute the warning using the respective buttons.
